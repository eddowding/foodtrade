But this time, make it awesome. \n\nI want to live in a world that makes sense. I want to live in a world where I can buy a shirt and know that it’s been made by a person who is paid well and works in safe conditions. That it is made from materials grown responsibly using smartest and most harmonious techniques we have. That it has been processed safely, with respect to the environment and local resources, and without creating pollution. \n\nI want to live in a world where the apple I pick of the shelf is the fresh from a local farm. Not one which has been shipped half way around the world. \n\nI want to know that my mobile phone is not contributing to a civil war in the DRC.

It has delivered abundant food and energy, antibiotics and micro-surgery, the ability to travel anywhere in the world in less than a day, pocket-sized devices which make us omniscient... we have it good. \n\nBut these luxuries of civilisation come at a cost. A cost which, until recently, we’ve either not been aware of, or which we felt was an acceptable trade-off for the benefits gained.\n\nThis is no longer true. We understand now that many of the supply-chains which make today's world possible are dangerously brittle and scarce, and have an unacceptable impact on our fellow humans and species, and our planet. \n\n\n\n\nIt’s perfectly possible to imagine a world where \n\n\nhttp://bteam.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is why sustainable sourcing is vital. We need to find ways to rewire civilisation’s supply chains. And to keep delivering the same benefits. But without the negative impact. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmake our supply chains sustainable. \n\nIf we don’t, much of the fabric of modern civilisation will unravel, and humanity will take a massive step \n\nWe need to ensure our supply-chains are sustainable \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m sure you’ve heard the Chinese curse “May you live in interesting times!” \n\nIt's hard to deny that our world today is HUGELY interesting: there's SO much going on, and we can access pretty much all of it. \n\nBut to suggest this is a curse would seem to miss the fact that this is the biggest ever opportunity to be completely awesome.\n\nCivilisation delivers some incredible things: Abundant food and energy, antibiotics and micro-surgery, the ability to travel anywhere in the world in less than a day, pocket-sized devices which give answers to any question... you'd have to agree that in the context of history, we are god-like.\n\nBut these luxuries of civilisation come at a cost. A cost which, until recently, we’ve either not been aware of, or which we felt was an acceptable trade-off for the benefits gained.\n\nThis is no longer true. We now understand that many of the supply-chains which make today's world possible are dangerously brittle and scarce, and have an unacceptable impact on our fellow humans and species, and our planet.\n\nSo the challenge of our time is to rewire civilisation’s supply chains. And to keep delivering the same benefits. But without the negative impact. \n\nWait - WHAT??! Did I really just suggest that we must basically re-build civilisation, but this time with none of the down-sides??!\n\nYes. Yes, I did. \n\nIt is a huge challenge, but we agreed at the start: the powers we have at our disposal are god-like. \n\nLet's look at what we actually have to do, because when you start to unravel the fabric of modern life, much of it seems so absurd that you have to wonder why and how it exists. \n\nIt also quickly becomes obvious is that not only can we make them less harmful, many of them can be done away with entirely, and those which remain can made be made massively beneficial. \n\nTake, for example, the hospital in Nottingham which set to improve the sustainability of the meals it served. They found by sourcing more food locally they saved £800,000 per year. In part this saving came from buying more directly, e.g. whole onions and not pre-sliced ones. This cut packaging and created a local source of compost. But this also means more work for the kitchen staff, though because they chefs are more involved and have focus, they learnt new skills, and took more pride in their work. And so the meals became tastier and healthier, making happier, healthier patients. \n\nThis single restructured supply chain saved £800,000 per year, put millions into the local economy, cut waste, and gave people health, skills and pride. \n\nHere's an example of one we can do away with: The UK exports 4400 tonnes of ice cream to Italy. And then we import 4200 back again. Imagine all the energy wasted moving 8,600 tonnes of food 1100 miles, all the hours behind the wheel, doing paperwork, all the lorries to buy and maintain.. all just squandering resources. It's pretty shameful. And yet so easy to fix!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might like to have a look at the Zero Carbon Britain 2030 report, watch a lecture from the Rocky Mountain Institute, or read up on Virgin's B-Team for further inspiration. \n\n\n\nTHERE ARE THE THINGS YOU CAN MAKE BETTER\n \nDESIGNING OUT WASTE\n\nOPPORTUNITIES WIDE OPEN\n\nALIGNED WITH VALUES, BUTTER CUSTOMERS\n\nOLD GUARD IS DYING\nAUTHENTICITY OF DELIVERY\nSCALE THROUGH NETWORK  NOT SIZE\nNOBLE VICOTRY - TECH, PEOPLE, PLANET, RESOURCES\n\nTake a step back \n\nWhy would we ever think of shipping apples from New Zealand to the UK when there are plenty available in the UK? We import 22,000 tonnes of potatoes from Egypt and export 27,000 tonnes back the other way. And in doing so we needlessly consume resources, miss out local employment opportunities, and in the case of food lose nutritional content. \n\n\n\n It’s just a matter of being bold with your imagination, and being audacious with your ambitions. Remember: this challenge is not optional. We are not easily going to give up the benefits of modern life, but we are running out of the resources which it possible. By shifting to more sustainable sourcing you will be pushing against an open door. \n \nThe internet has come just at the right time - you have global media to share ideas and build engagement. You have open access to cutting edge science. The tools of production have never cost less. On the technology side, everything we need to make this change happen is there for the taking. \n \n\nED DOWDING\n\nEd is the founder of FoodTrade (www.foodtrade.com / @foodtradeHQ) which helps businesses map their supply chain to avoid risk, showcase provenance, and help them find ways to trade and collaborate more effectively. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe movement towards making sourcing sustainable is no longer marginal nor leftfield. Businesses taking the long view are recognising that to maintain a competitive advantage in tomorrow’s economic climate requires more than a business as usual approach.\n \nHow we do businesses and who we choose to do it with speaks volumes about our commitment towards supporting those who are embracing enlightened business models fit for the future.\n   \nHence why we recently renamed ourselves ‘FoodTrade’ we want to be the new industry norm.\n  \nWherever you look for a statistic or performance indicator everything points towards a strong and steady increases in those sectors where value is far more than just financial.\n \n·      Global organic sales have risen 25% in the last 3 years.\n·      Vegetable box schemes have seen a 10% rise in the last year alone.\n \nPeople are increasingly looking to put their money where their mouth is.\n \nWe make it easier for businesses and consumers  align with those who share their values.\n \nThese are all trends which are applicable not just to food but to every area of the economy.\n \nintegrate sustainable practices from the word go. There is no place for starting out today with yesterday’s business model.\n \nAnd the reward for taking the long view? A new type of growth.\n \nWe have reached the end of unabated outward growth. Growth must now come from building greater complexity and value into our existing networks rather than building out new ones.\n     \n\n\n\n\nAnd what's more, we now have the wisdom not just of ONE person and ONE lifetime - we have access to the brainpower and wisdom of millions of people, both now and throughout history. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil recently we’ve not really considered where everything comes from which makes all this possible, . \n\n\n \nNow is a hugely exciting time to be young, enthusiastic and questioning how we transition towards a sustainable future.\n \nTowards sustainable supply chains which are desirable not in spite of their commitment to incorporating social and environmental values but because of them.  \n \nThe movement towards making sourcing sustainable is no longer marginal nor leftfield. Businesses taking the long view are recognising that to maintain a competitive advantage in tomorrow’s economic climate requires more than a business as usual approach.\n \nHow we do businesses and who we choose to do it with speaks volumes about our commitment towards supporting those who are embracing enlightened business models fit for the future.\n \nGone are the days of it being acceptable to conjure up reasons to avoid making that transition, now, today.\n \nFoodTrade exists to aid and speed up this process of transition towards better and more enlightened business activity.\n \nWe are working to enable food businesses and individuals to trade more easily and far better with other businesses who share their social and environmental values.\n \nIf we are to transition to a more sustainable world we must have built in mechanisms for predicating sustainable business activities.\n \nBusinesses who are leading the way in operating triple bottom line accounts must be rewarded with our custom and publicity.\n \nThere is no place for wearing a hair shirt anymore or championing sustainable businesses practices alone – we must work together to build strong, resilient networks.\n \nBy helping to increase trade between businesses who champion enlightened business models we demonstrate to other businesses the desirability of making the transition.\n \nHence why we recently renamed ourselves ‘FoodTrade’ we want to be the new industry norm.\n \nThe strong, resilient networks of the future must be built around the businesses who already ‘get it’ outwards towards those who will get there soon with our help.\n   \nWherever you look for a statistic or performance indicator everything points towards a strong and steady increases in those sectors where value is far more than just financial.\n \n·      Global organic sales have risen 25% in the last 3 years.\n·      Vegetable box schemes have seen a 10% rise in the last year alone.\n \nPeople are increasingly looking to put their money where their mouth is.\n \nWe make it easier for businesses and consumers to do the right thing – to align with businesses who share their values.\n \nThese are all trends which are applicable not just to food but to every area of the economy.\n \nFor the youth of today the only practical way to start a business is to integrate sustainable practices from the word go. There is no place for starting out today with yesterday’s business model.\n \nAnd the reward for taking the long view? A new type of growth.\n \nWe have reached the end of unabated outward growth. Growth must now come from building greater complexity and value into our existing networks rather than building out new ones.\n \nNew value is found in producing greater Goods and less externalities are a result of business behavior.\n \nThe more desirable we make transition to a sustainable future, the quicker we can convince others to get on board.\n \nOur job? To rewire the food system to take full advantage of the benefits it can deliver. We’re excited. \n\n",
