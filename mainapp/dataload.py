2.3 PromotionChinese Wet Markets[edit]

Wet markets traditionally were places that sell live animals out in the open. This includes poultry, fish, reptiles, and pigs. However, since SARS, large animals and poultry are not as commonly found in the markets in Hong Kong, though live fish, shellfish, and frogs are widely available. Some markets also sell exotic animals.[2] Fresh fruits and vegetables are also available. Wet markets also generally include butcher shops with fresh meat. The fresh meat and fish sections are separate from the fruit and vegetable stalls. Many markets also have stalls that sell dried goods, flowers, and processed tofu as well as cooked meat.[3]
In Hong Kong the wet markets are most frequented by older Hong Kongers, those with lower incomes, and domestic helpers who serve approximately 10% of Hong Kong's residents.[3][4] Recently they have become sites of interest to tourists as places to see the "real Hong Kong",.[5][6]
Many of the wet market buildings are owned by property investment firms and as a result the price of food can vary from market to market.[7] In general, the owner of the wet market building is responsible for maintaining the building infrastructure. Stalls are rented out to retailers, who purchase and sell their goods independently. This is in contrast to a supermarket which is operated by a single company.
For some customers, it is important to see the animal live before being sold. Specifically, they may want to check its health and quality. This is generally not an option in supermarkets, except in lobster or fish booths. Most wet markets have facilities for allowing a customer to choose a live animal, then either take it home as is or watch it killed and cleaned.

Marketing mix[edit]

Product[edit]
In deciding what type of new food products a consumer would most prefer, a manufacturer can either try to develop a new food product or try to modify or extend an existing food. For example, a sweet, flavored yogurt drink would be a new product, but milk in a new flavor (such as chocolate strawberry) would be an extension of an existing product. There are three steps to both developing and extending: generate ideas, screen ideas for feasibility, and test ideas for appeal. Only after these steps will a food product make it to national market. Of one hundred new food product ideas that are considered, only six make it to a supermarket shelf.
 Manufacturers may be able to leverage their existing brand names by developing new product lines. For example, Heinz started out as a brand for pickles but branched out into ketchup. Some brand extensions may involve a risk of damage to the original brand if the quality is not good enough. Coca Cola, for example, refused to apply the Coke name to a diet drink back when artificial sweeteners had a significantly less attractive taste. 
The food industry faces numerous marketing decisions. Money can be invested in brand building (through advertising and other forms of promotion) to increase either quantity demanded or the price consumers are willing to pay for a product. Coca Cola, for example, spends a great deal of money both on perfecting its formula and on promoting the brand. This allows Coke to charge more for its product than can makers of regional and smaller brands.
In profitably pricing the food, the manufacturer must keep in mind that the retailer adds approximately 50 percent to the price of a wholesale product. For example, a frozen food sold in a retail store for $4.50 generates an income of $3.00 for the manufacturer. This money has to pay for the cost of producing, packaging, shipping, storing, and selling the product.
Promotion[edit]
Coke created Tab Cola, but only when aspartame (NutraSweet)  For loyalty to be present, it is not enough to merely observe that the consumer buys the same brand consistently. The consumer, to be brand loyal, must be able to actively resist promotional efforts by competitors. A brand loyal consumer will continue to buy the preferred brand even if a competing product is improved, offers a price promotion or premium, or receives preferred display space. Some consumers have multi-brand loyalty. Here, a consumer switches between a few preferred brands. The consumer may either alternate for variety or may, as a rule of thumb, buy whichever one of the preferred brands is on sale. This consumer, however, would not switch to other brands on sale. Brand loyalty is, of course, a matter of degree. Some consumers will not switch for a moderate discount, but would switch for a large one or will occasionally buy another brand for convenience or variety.
Promoting a food to consumers is done out of store, in store, and on package. Advertisements on television and in magazines are attempts to persuade consumers to think favorably about a product, so that they go to the store to purchase the product. In addition to advertising, promotions can also include Sunday newspaper ads that offer coupons such as cents-off and buy-one-get-one-free offers.
Place[edit] was approved for use in soft drinks did Coca Cola come out with a Diet Coke. Manufacturers that have invested a great deal of money in brands may have developed a certain level of consumer brand loyalty that is, a tendency for consumers to continue to buy a preferred brand even when an attractive offer is made by competitors.
Place refers to the distribution and warehousing efforts necessary to move a food from the manufacturer to a location where a consumer can buy it. It can also refer to where the product is located in a retail outlet (e.g., the end of an aisle; the top, bottom, or middle shelf; in a special display case, etc.).
The food marketing system in the United States is an amazingly flexible one. Consumer focus helps marketers anticipate the demands of consumers, and production focus helps them respond to changes in the market. The result is a system that meets the ever-changing demands of consumers.

World Trade Organization (WTO) General-Director Roberto Azevedo speaks during the... Read More
The first major agreement to update global trade rules in two decades moved nearer after the U.S. and India bridged differences over agriculture subsidies and food security, people familiar with the negotiations said.

World Trade Organization Director-General Roberto Azevedo late yesterday circulated a draft text of an accord for the 159-member group to consider as the talks continued through the night in Bali, Indonesia, said people involved in the discussions who requested anonymity.

The draft's provisions include measures to help smooth customs procedures and "allow developing countries more options for providing food security," the Geneva-based WTO said in a statement on its website.

Success in reaching an agreement that supporters say could add $1 trillion to the world economy may help extend talks on the Doha trade negotiations, which have have dragged on for 12 years. Failure in Indonesia would diminish confidence in the arbiter of trade disputes, WTO and U.S. officials have said.

 Smoothing customs procedures would help democratize access to the global marketplace, while the package would provide a longoverdue signal that the WTO can serve as a negotiating forum among its broad membership Jake Colvin vice president for global trade issues at the Washington-based National Foreign Trade Council said by e-mail from Bali as the late-night talks got underway.

Uruguay Round

An accord in Bali would be the first major agreement among the entire WTO membership since the organization inception. The last significant deal among members was the Uruguay Round, settled in 1993, Colvin said.

The deal if approved would let India and other developing nations continue to subsidize their crops to bolster food security without having to worry about legal challenges, so long as the practice doesn't distort trade, according to the draft.

The U.S. and other WTO members would retain the right to file a complaint if the subsidized goods are sold in global markets and depress prices or harm competitors.

The WTO draft calls for the establishment of an  "interim mechanism" that would be in place until members reach a permanent solution. India is still seeking changes to WTO agriculture rules that would exempt its food program altogether from limits on subsidies.

Protectionist Policies

Susan Ariel Aaronson, professor of international affairs who specializes in trade policy at George Washington University in Washington, said the compromise was a trade-off that keeps in place protectionist agricultural policies for the sake of the larger trading system.

 "You always have to buy trade liberalization with some protectionism" at the international level, she said in a phone interview. If that allows the WTO to achieve some success in opening trade, it's a good thing, she said.

The draft includes provisions to cut red tape at borders, a step sought by shippers including FedEx Corp. of Memphis, Tennessee, and United Parcel Service Inc. of Atlanta.

Public Citizen, a Washington-based consumer organization, was skeptical of the effectiveness of a potential accord, saying the draft includes watered-down provisions that simply let the WTO save face after years of stalled talks.

 "Reviewing the actual text of the agreement, it appears that the biggest 'breakthrough' was simply that yet another WTO Ministerial meeting did not melt down altogether," Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch program, said in a statement.

Food Rights

Anti-poverty campaign group War on Want said the Bali talks hadn't resulted in universal rights to food.

 "The negotiations have failed to secure permanent protection for countries to safeguard the food rights of their peoples, exposing hundreds of millions to the prospect of hunger and starvation," John Hilary, the London-based group's executive director, said by e-mail yesterday.

Others were more sanguine.

 "This is a victory for India over the short term," said K.M. Gopakumar, a legal adviser to the Third World Network, a New Delhi-based policy research group that advises the government on trade agreements.  "It will allow India to set its own prices for certain subsidized foods instead of being forced to use lower international benchmarks."

India's Position

A deal originally looked unlikely this week as India's Commerce Minister Anand Sharma said the country's food security was non-negotiable. India had sought to exempt food-security plans from being counted under subsidy spending caps, while the U.S. was concerned that a surplus from India's food program may get dumped onto world markets.

 "India speaks for the vast majority of poor people in the developing countries and the poor countries," Sharma told reporters in Bali this week.

India Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's Congress-led coalition allocated 900 billion rupees ($15 billion) in food subsidies in the fiscal year ending March 31, up 6 percent from last year. His party has championed rural programs in a nation with 1.2 billion people that is home to a third of the world's poor, according to the World Bank.

Singh's government, facing elections due by May 2014, has seen its popularity fall because of graft scandals, the weakest economic growth in a decade and consumer inflation that has exceeded 9 percent for 20 months.

Regional Accords

The talks in Bali may put the focus back on regional trade deals, said Alan Bollard, executive director of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping, whose leaders also met in Bali this year.

 "The WTO negotiations have got so complex with 159 different countries involved that we are really wondering whether there is a future for these very big, complete, comprehensive agreements," Bollard told Bloomberg TV Indonesia in an interview in Bali Dec. 5.

U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a Dec. 4 speech in Bali that failure to reach an agreement  "would deal a debilitating blow to the WTO as a forum for multilateral negotiations."

After the discussions conclude, Froman and ministers from some Asia-Pacific countries will head to Singapore for talks on the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord, with the goal of reaching an agreement before Jan. 1. The leak last month of a document purported to be part of the draft text dented optimism that those negotiations can be concluded by that date, Mustapa Mohamed, Malaysia's international trade minister, said in a Nov. 20 interview with Bloomberg.
